            Apple Inc.had its genesis in the lifelong dream of Stephan G.Woynisk to build his own computer--a dream that was made suddenly feasible with the arrival in 1975 of the first commercially succesfully microcomputer,the Altair 8800, which came as a kit and used therecently invented micropricessor chip.Encouraged by his friends at the Homebrew Computer Club,a San Francisco Bay area group centred around the Altair,Woyniak uickly came up with a plan for his own microcomputer.
